# Roo - A smart bookmarking search engine for your browser

![Dall-E 2 generated logo](static/roo-logo.png)

## Introduction

`Roo` (short for "Kangaroo") is a smart bookmarking and productivity CLI tool that works as a custom search engine for your browser, allowing you to quickly issue commands in your browser's search bar. It's a simple server that accepts a search query and redirects to the appropriate URI based on a set of predefined (and customizable) rules.

`Roo` is useful for personal productivity, but many users run it on company servers to allow all employees to share a common way to quickly access internal and external tools, wikis, documentation and resources.

Roo is heavily inspired by [bunny1](https://github.com/ccheever/bunny1), a bookmarking tool created at Facebook and open-sourced in 2012. It's written in Rust and released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).

## Built-in commands

Roo comes with a set of default commands that can be fully customized.

## Installation

### Install from Crates.io

If you are a Rust programmer you can install `roo_engine` with `cargo`

```bash
cargo install roo_engine
```

### Install with Homebrew (Mac)

```bash
brew tap marcocampana/tap
brew install roo_engine
```

### Check out the repository

If you are on MacOs, installing with homebrew is the recommended choice. However, you can also check out the repository on your machine and run with `cargo`.

1. [Install Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
1. Check out the repository from GitHub

    ```bash
    git checkout git@github.com:marcocampana/roo_engine.git
    ```

1. Run with Cargo

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

## How to

### Start the server

If you installed the binary, you can start the server by executing the `roo_engine` binary in your terminal:

```bash
roo_engine
```

or if you using `cargo` you can run:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will start `roo_engine` on `127.0.0.1:3030`.

You can use the `--help` argument to print all the available arguments you can use to run `roo`.

```bash
roo --help
```

### Add `roo_engine` as your default search engine in Chrome

1. Go to `chrome://settings/searchEngines`
2. Click on `Add` under `Search engines` and use this URL `http://127.0.0.1:3030/?q=%s`
3. Optionally set this as your default search engine for maximum productivityâ„¢

### Define your own commands

`roo_engine` takes your search query and tries to match it against the list of defined commands. Buil-in commands that ship with `roo_engine` are found in the [parser.rs](parser.rs) file. You can make your own rules file and tell `roo` where to find it at startup:

```bash
roo --path ~/my_file.toml
```

A `roo_engine` command looks like this:

```toml
[[command]]
 input = "g (.+)"
 output = "https://www.google.com/search?q={}"
```

the `input` string is a regex that is matched against the input of your browser's search bar. If a match is found the regex group captured in `()` is replaced in the `{}` found on the output string where the browser redirects. In the example above we are defining a command `g` that will match a string `g <search query>` that redirects to Google search to search for `<search query>`.

See [rules.toml](rules.toml) for sample commands.

### Example: JIRA tasks

If you are a JIRA user you know that JIRA task ids have the format `<PROJECT_PREFIX>-<TASK_NUMBER>`. You could write a custom command that allows you to input the task id in your browser search bar and be redirected to the task details. For example, let's assume that your project prefix is `MP` you could define the following rule:

```toml
[[command]]
 input = "(MP-.+)"
 output = "https://marcocampana.atlassian.net/browse/{}"
```

## Run in the background

On MacOs you can setup `launchd` to automatically run `roo_engine` in the background.

1. create a `plist` file in the `~/Library/LaunchAgents` folder (make sure to specify the absolute path
to the code in your machine instead of`/Users/myuser`)

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
 <dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>com.marcocampana.roo_engine</string>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <true/>
  
  <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
  <string>/User/myuser/code/roo_engine</string>

  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
     <array>
        <string><PATH_TO>/User/myuser/.cargo/bin/cargo</string>
        <string>run</string>
     </array>
 </dict>
</plist>
```

2. Load the configuration to start the server:

 ```bash
 launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.marcocampana.roo_engine.plist
 ```
